# BOTW_item_search

This project uses [this](https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API/#/) API for data. This is a simple search tool that returns a random item from the video game, Breath of the Wild, based on location and/or category.

This simple server was created with Node.js, and the front-end with Javascript and Bootstrap. This project was deployed on Heroku and can be viewed [here](https://enigmatic-garden-94515.herokuapp.com/).
